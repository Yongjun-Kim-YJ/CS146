Initialize left = 0
Initialize right = B.length-1;

while left <= right
    Calculate mid = average of mid;
    if B[mid] is 0
        Return index of mid + 1 (counting from 1)
    else if mid > 0 and B[mid-1] < A[mid-1]
        then 0 is to the left of mid
        Set right = mid-1;
    else
        then 0 is to the right of mid
        Set left = mid+1;

Return -1 since 0 is not found in the loop
