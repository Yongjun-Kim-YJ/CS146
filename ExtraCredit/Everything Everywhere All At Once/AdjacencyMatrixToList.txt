Pseudocode:
function adjacencyMatrixToList(matrix):
    Initialize an empty list (or dictionary) adjList
    for each vertex i in matrix:
        Initialize an empty list for vertex i
        for each vertex j in matrix:
            if matrix[i][j] is not 0:
                Add j to the list for vertex i
        Add the list for vertex i to adjList
    return adjList

Explanation:
- An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where the element at matrix[i][j] indicates whether there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j.
- To convert it to an adjacency list, we iterate through the matrix and for each i,
   we create a list of all j where matrix[i][j] is not 0 (indicating an edge from i to j).
- The adjacency list is a list (or dictionary) where each vertex maps to a list of its neighbors.

Finding:
An adjacency list makes it more efficient to iterate over the edges of a particular vertex,
which is beneficial for algorithms like DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search).
