Pseudocode:
function reverseEdges(adjList):
    Initialize a new adjacency list newAdjList for the reversed graph
    for each vertex v in adjList:
        for each neighbor n of vertex v in adjList[v]:
            Add v to the list of n in newAdjList
    return newAdjList

Explanation:
- To reverse the direction of each edge in a directed graph, we need to swap the direction of every edge.
  If there was an edge from u to v, it should be changed to from v to u.
- If using an adjacency list, for each vertex, we remove the edge to its neighborand add an edge from the neighbor back to the vertex.

Finding:
The reversal of edges can significantly impact the behavior and outcome of graph algorithms.
For instance, the reversal might change the components reachable from a given vertex in a directed graph.
