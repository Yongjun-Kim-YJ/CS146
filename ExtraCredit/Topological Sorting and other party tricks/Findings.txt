1. Kahn's Algorithm:
- Iteratively removes nodes with no incoming edges.
- Suitable for detecting cycles and ensuring that all nodes are processed.
2. BFS (using Kahn's Method):
- Essentially the same as Kahn's but categorized under BFS due to its level-wise processing.
3. DFS:
- Uses recursion to explore nodes, marking nodes temporarily and permanently to detect cycles.
- The nodes are added to the result list in post-order (reversed at the end).

Results:
Kahn's and BFS Topological Sort: ['A', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'E', 'G', 'H', 'F']
DFS Topological Sort: ['A', 'D', 'B', 'E', 'G', 'H', 'C', 'F']
