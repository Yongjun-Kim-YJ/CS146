Initialize missingRanges

Set next = lower bound of the range (inclusive)

for 0 to IDs.length
    if IDs[i] > upper break the loop
    if IDs[i] < next continue;
    if IDs[i] > next
        add missingRanges from next to IDs[i]-1

    Update next = current ID + 1

if next <= upper bound:
    Add missingRanges from next to upper bound

Return missingRanges
