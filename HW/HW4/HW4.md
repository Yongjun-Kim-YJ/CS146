## Problem 1: Insertion Sort
- Best Case: (O(n)) - In the best case, the array is already sorted, so each element is compared only once.
- Average Case: (O(n^2)) - In the average case, each element is compared with about half of the previous elements.
- Worst Case: (O(n^2)) -  In the worst case, each element is compared with all previous elements.

## Problem 2 : Matrix Multiplication
- For matrix A of size m x n and matrix B of size n x p, the resulting matrix C will be of size m x p.
- Each element in C requires n multiplications and additions.
- Thus, the overall time complexity for matrix multiplication is O(m * n * p).
- Best Case: O(m * n * p)
- Average Case: O(m * n * p)
- Worst Case: O(m * n * p)
