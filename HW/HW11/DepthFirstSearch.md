1. Identify the Starting Point: Begin at the pixel given by the `starting pixel` coordinates (sr, sc).
2. Check for Base Cases: 
   - If the `starting pixel` is out of bounds or not of the original color, return.
   - If the color of the `starting pixel` is already the new color, no action is needed.
3. Color the Pixel: Change the color of the `starting pixel` to the new color.
4. Recursion: Recursively apply the same logic to all four directionally connected pixels (up, down, left, right).
