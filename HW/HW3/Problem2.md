## Problem 2 : Matrix Multiplication
- For matrix A of size m x n and matrix B of size n x p, the resulting matrix C will be of size m x p.
- Each element in C requires n multiplications and additions.
- Thus, the overall time complexity for matrix multiplication is O(m * n * p).
- Best Case: O(m * n * p)
- Average Case: O(m * n * p)
- Worst Case: O(m * n * p)
