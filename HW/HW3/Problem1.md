## Problem 1: Insertion Sort
- Best Case: (O(n)) - In the best case, the array is already sorted, so each element is compared only once.
- Average Case: (O(n^2)) - In the average case, each element is compared with about half of the previous elements.
- Worst Case: (O(n^2)) -  In the worst case, each element is compared with all previous elements.
