1. Count Character Frequencies: Use `collections.Counter` and `Hashmap` to count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. Initialize Length and Odd Flag:
   - Initialize a variable `length` to 0, which will store the length of the longest palindrome.
   - Initialize a boolean flag `oddFound` to `False`, which will indicate if there is any character with an odd frequency.
3. Iterate Through Frequencies:
   - If a character's frequency is even, add it directly to `length`.
   - If a character's frequency is odd, add the largest even part to `length` and set `oddFound` to `True`.
4. Adjust for Odd Frequency:
   - After processing all characters, if `oddFound` is `True`, increment `length` by 1, accounts for placing one odd frequency character in the center.
5. Return the Result: Return `length`.
