1. Separate and Sort Start and End Times
2. Use Two Pointers to Traverse Start and End Times:
   - Initialize two pointers, one for the start times and one for the end times.
   - Initialize a counter for the number of servers needed.
3. Count Overlaps to Determine Maximum Concurrent Jobs:
   - Traverse through the sorted start times.
   - For each start time, if it is >= to the current end time, move the end pointer to the next end time (this indicates a server has been freed).
   - Increment the server counter for each start time and decrement it when an end time is encountered.
4. Return the Maximum Number of Servers Needed
