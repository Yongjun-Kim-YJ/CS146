1. Binary Search Initialization:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`. The `left` pointer starts at 1 and the `right` pointer starts at `n`.
2. Mid Calculation:
   - Calculate the mid-point of the current range: `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
3. Check the Mid Version:
   - Use the `isBadVersion(mid)` API to check if the mid version is bad.
4. Adjust the Pointers:
   - If `mid` is a bad version, it means the first bad version could be `mid` or somewhere before `mid`. Therefore, move the `right` pointer to `mid`.
   - If `mid` is not a bad version, it means the first bad version must be after `mid`. Therefore, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
5. Completion:
   - Continue the process until `left` meets `right`. At this point, `left` will be pointing to the first bad version.
